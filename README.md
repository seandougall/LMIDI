## System Requirements

macOS 10.11 or later

Could likely be updated to support iOS; haven't delved into that yet.

## Basic usage

LMIDI's operation is coordinated by a central `LMIDIConfig` class, which you can instantiate with `LMIDIConfig(name:)`. You can instantiate more than one of these (one per document, for example) if desired; each will maintain an instance of `MIDIClient` under the hood. 

Get all avaliable inputs and outputs with `config.inputSources` and `config.outputDestinations`. These are instances of `LMIDISource` and `LMIDIDestination`, which roughly wrap Core MIDI's `MIDIEndpointRef`.

Processing input:

    let source: LMIDISource = ...
    let input = try LMIDIInput(source: source, portName: "Input 1") // make sure to keep this instance around somehow
    try input.listen { messages in
        for msg in messages {
            print("\(msg)")
        }
    }

Sending output:

    let destination: LMIDIDestination = ...
    let output = try LMIDIOutput(destination: destination, portName: "Output 1") // keep this instance around too
    output.send(.noteOn(channel: 4, note: 64, velocity: 127))

MIDI message types are enumerated by `LMIDIMessage`. This includes SysEx messages, whose associated data is an array of the bytes contained in the message (not including the opening `F0` or the closing `F7`).

Note that channel numbers range from 0-15 (matching the MIDI data), not 1-16 (matching traditional UI display). You will need to add 1 to the channel number when formatting for display to the user. 

## MIDI controller handling

Incoming controller messages get passed to your `input.listen` block, just like any other message. But if you would like to have LMIDI keep track of controller state, you can use an instance of the `LMIDIControllerState` class to do so. This object will track coarse/fine pairings and manage reconstructing 14-bit values for those controllers.

`LMIDIControllerState` can be used the hard way, or you can simply attach one to your input in order to have it process all incoming messages automatically:

    let input = try LMIDIInput(...
    input.controllerState = LMIDIControllerState()
    try input.listen { messages in
        // Messages are processed by the controllerState object before this code is called
        print("\(input.controllerState!.getNormalizedValue(channel: 0, type: .volume)") // Returns a value within [0.0, 1.0]
    }

## Known issues

`LMIDIConfig` is meant to provide notifications of changes in configuration state; this is not yet implemented.
